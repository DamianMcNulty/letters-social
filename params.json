As a new employee, you're going to be working with the latest and greatest technologies as you learn the ropes of our company. We were very impressed with your comment box project and are going to get you set up on a new project: Letters Socialâ„¢. Letters Socialâ„¢ is a groundbreaking new social experience. You can comment, you can post; it's like nothing you've ever seen before.\r\n\r\nFor this project, you'll be using React. React, you might remember, is a hot new technology for building user interfaces. You've been learning about it and at this point you can take advantage of what you know about data in React, parent and child components, JSX, and now lifecycle methods. You can find the source code for this app at [github.com/react-in-action/letters-social](https://github.com/react-in-action/letters-social)\r\n\r\nWhen you're done, your project should satisfy the following requirements:\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\n*   âœ… display posts and comments from the Letters Socialâ„¢ API\r\n*   âœ… create new posts for the Letters Socialâ„¢ API\r\n*   âœ… each post should have display likes, comments, and crawled links if available\r\n*   âœ… filter posts by category\r\n*   âœ… display metadata about a post; number of comments, likes, etc.\r\n*   âœ… hide and show comments\r\n*   âœ… update the like count for posts and comments\r\n\r\nProjects in future chapters will add more to the Letters Social experience, including:\r\n\r\nUser profile:\r\n\r\n*   âœ… display user profile info\r\n*   âœ… allow users to edit their profile\r\n\r\nSearch box typeahead:\r\n\r\n*   âœ… allow users to search posts and comments\r\n*   âœ… display search results in-line\r\n*   âœ… display search results in a separate page\r\n\r\nUser signup, login, and account management:\r\n\r\n*   âœ… allow users to sign up\r\n*   âœ… allow users to log in\r\n*   âœ… allow users to manage their settings\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nThe Letters team\r\n",
